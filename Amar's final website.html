      	<p style="color: white; border-bottom: 2px solid blue;">This is my portfolio website of my progress throughout the school year. </p>
			Hello! I'm Amar Shohatee, I'm currently a sophomore and attend Fordson high School and Michael Berry Career Center. Throughout the school year I’ve accomplished a lot. Once I walked in this class on the first day of school, I already had a feeling that we would have to do a lot of work. I was able to experience how to use all different types of applications such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Rhino, and Flash. I am certified in Adobe illustrator knowing the basics and a whole lot more.
			<hr style="color: red; background-color: blue;">
          
            I'm interested in becoming an Engineer. I’ve always had mix feelings on becoming a an Engineer or a Real estate agent. The reason why I had thoughts on Real estate was because I come             from a family that are real estate agents or are in the business industry. I’ve loved cars ever since I was a kid and had an interest in engineering.
            <hr style="color: red; background-color: blue;">
